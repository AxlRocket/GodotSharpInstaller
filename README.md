# GodotSharpInstaller

I was bored to check manually if a Godot.NET 4 update was available, so I created this little soft that automaticcaly checks for updates.

Additionally, it can "install" and "uninstall" every Godot.NET version (if it was installed from GodotSharpInstaller)

Of course, it is possible to install several versions (Godot 4.2.1 and Godot 3.5.3 for example)

## About

The app is accessible in the system tray. By double click the system tray icon you can access the main form app and "install" or "uninstall" all the versions you want

In the main form app :

If you want the app to be started with window don't forget to check the option in the "options" menu

If you want the app to do not check the Godot 4 versions don't forget to check it too in the "options" menu
