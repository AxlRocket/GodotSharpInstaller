# GodotSharpInstaller

I was bored to check manually if a Godot.NET 4 update was available, so I created this little soft that automaticcaly checks for updates.

Additionally, it can "install" and "uninstall" every Godot.NET version (if it was installed from GodotSharpInstaller)

Of course, it is possible to install several versions (Godot 4.2.1 and Godot 3.5.3 for example)

## About
